    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        REMIX! Here at HelloFresh, we’re all about a mash-up. This week, our chefs combined two dishes that were <br>
        totally meant to be. Sweet-and-savory teriyaki chicken is piled into steamy tortillas along with pickled red <br>
        onion and a tangy, crunchy slaw. For a finishing touch, the tacos are sprinkled with sesame seeds. One bite <br>
        will make your taste buds sing.
    </p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 Red Onion</li>
        <li>5 Tsp Red Wine Vinegar</li>
        <li>1 Tsp Sriracha</li>
        <li>2 Tbsp Sour Cream</li>
        <li>4 oz Shredded Red Cabbage</li>
        <li>10 oz Chicken Breast Strips</li>
        <li>8 Tbsp Teriyaki Sauce</li>
        <li>1 Tbsp Sesame Seeds</li>
        <li>6 Flour Tortillas</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Cooking Instructions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>
            Wash and dry produce. Halve, peel, and very thinly slice onion. In a small bowl, combine half the <br>
            vinegar (you’ll use the rest later), ½ tsp sugar (1 tsp for 4 servings), and a pinch of salt and pepper. <br>
            Add ¼ of the sliced onion; toss to coat. Set aside, stirring occasionally, until ready to serve.
        </li>
        <li>
            In a medium bowl, combine sour cream, remaining vinegar, ½ tsp sugar (1 tsp for 4 servings), and <br>
            sriracha (start with half and add more if you like things spicy). Stir in half the cabbage. Season <br>
            with salt and pepper. Set aside, stirring occasionally, until ready to serve.
        </li>
        <li>
            Heat a large drizzle of oil in a large pan over medium-high heat. Add remaining onion and cabbage <br>
            and season with salt and pepper. Cook, stirring, until slightly softened, 2-3 minutes.
        </li>
        <li>
            Meanwhile, pat chicken dry with paper towels. Add to pan with veggies along with another drizzle <br>
            of oil, salt, and pepper. Cook, stirring often, until chicken is browned and cooked through, <br>
            4-6 minutes.
        </li>
        <li>
            Add teriyaki sauce to pan; bring to a boil. Reduce to a low simmer and cook until sauce is slightly <br>
            thickened and coats chicken and veggies, 4-6 minutes. Stir in half the sesame seeds. Season with <br>
            salt and pepper.
        </li>
        <li>
            Wrap tortillas in damp paper towels and microwave until warm and pliable, 30 seconds. Divide <br>
            chicken and veggie mixture (using a slotted spoon if needed) between tortillas. Top with cabbage <br>
            slaw and pickled onion. Sprinkle with remaining sesame seeds and serve.
        </li>
    </ol>
