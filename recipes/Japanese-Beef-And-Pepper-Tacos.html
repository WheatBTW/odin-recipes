    <li>2 tablespoon Mayonnaise</li>
    <li>6 milliliters Ponzu Sauce</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon Sriracha</li>

    <li>Kosher Salt</li>

<h2>Cooking Instructions</h2>
<ol>
    <li>
        Wash and dry all produce. Halve, peel, and thinly slice onion. <br>
        Halve, core, and thinly slice bell pepper into strips. Peel and mince ginger. <br>
        Trim and thinly slice scallions, separating whites from greens. Quarter lime.
    </li>
    <li>
        In a small bowl, combine scallion whites, juice from half the lime, ½ tsp sugar (1 tsp for 4 <br> 
        servings), and a pinch of salt. Stir until sugar and salt have mostly dissolved. <br> 
        Set aside, stirring occasionally, until ready to serve.
    </li>
    <li>
        Heat a drizzle of oil in a large pan over medium-high heat. Add beef and ginger; season with salt <br> 
        and pepper. Cook, breaking up meat into pieces, until browned and cooked through, 4-6 minutes. <br> 
        Turn off heat. Using a slotted spoon, transfer beef to a plate and set aside. Wipe out pan.
    </li>
    <li>
        Heat a drizzle of oil in pan used for beef over medium-high heat. Add bell pepper and onion; <br>
         season with salt and pepper. Cook, stirring, until softened, 5-7 minutes. Return beef to pan and <br> 
         add teriyaki sauce. Cook, stirring, until mixture is coated and sauce is slightly thickened, 1-2 <br>
          minutes. Turn off heat.
        </li>
        <li>Meanwhile, wrap tortillas in damp paper towels and microwave until warm and pliable, <br>
             30 seconds. In a second small bowl, combine mayonnaise, ponzu, and sriracha to taste.
            </li>
            <li>Divide beef filling and pickled scallion whites between tortillas. Drizzle with sriracha-ponzu mayo <br>
                 and top with scallion greens. Serve with remaining lime wedges on the side.</li>
