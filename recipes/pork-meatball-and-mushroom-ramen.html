    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Our chefs are obsessed with ramen—and no, we don’t mean the microwave variety. We’re talking about <br>
        that soul-stirring combination of rich broth, tender meat and veggies, and a tangle of chewy noodles. This <br>
        version stars tender, ginger-infused pork meatballs in a super-flavorful broth with umami-packed <br>
        mushrooms and sweet, tender carrot slices. Each bowl’s topped off with a homemade garlic chili oil and <br>
        aromatic scallion greens. If you weren’t a hopeless ramen-tic yet, this will make you one.

    <h2>Cooking Instructions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>
            Adjust rack to top position and preheat oven to 425 degrees. Bring a large pot of salted water to a <br>
            boil. Wash and dry all produce. Peel and mince or grate garlic. Finely chop chili. Trim and thinly <br>
            slice scallions, separating whites from greens; finely chop whites. Peel and mince ginger until you <br>
            have 1 TBSP (2 TBSP for 4 servings). Trim and thinly slice mushrooms. Trim, peel, and halve carrot <br>
            lengthwise; thinly slice crosswise into half-moons.
        </li>
        <li>
            In a small microwave-safe bowl, combine ¼ of the garlic with 2 TBSP oil (4 TBSP for 4 servings); <br>
            microwave until fragrant, 30 seconds. Season with salt and add as much chili as you like. Set <br>
            aside. In a medium bowl, combine pork*, panko, scallion whites, 2 tsp minced ginger (4 tsp for 4), <br>
            ¾ tsp salt (1½ tsp for 4), and pepper. Form into 1-inch meatballs. Place meatballs on a baking <br>
            sheet. Roast on top rack until browned and cooked through, 12-15 minutes.
        </li>
        <li>
            Heat a large drizzle of oil in a medium pot over medium-high heat. Add mushrooms and carrot; <br>
            season  with salt and pepper. Cook, stirring, until browned and tender, 5-7 minutes. Add a drizzle <br>
            of oil, remaining garlic, and remaining minced ginger. Cook until fragrant, 30 seconds.
        </li>
        <li> 
            Add 3 cups water (6 cups for 4 servings), pork ramen stock concentrates, and mushroom stock concentrate <br>
            to pot with veggies; bring to a boil. Meanwhile, add noodles to large pot of boiling salted water <br>
            (not the broth!); cook until just tender, 1-2 minutes. Drain and rinse noodles <br>
            under cold water. Toss with a drizzle of oil.
        </li>
        <li>
            Once meatballs are done, reduce broth to a low simmer; add meatballs and any roasting juices <br>
            from baking sheet. Cook until flavors have combined, 2-3 minutes. Taste broth and season generously <br>
            with salt and pepper.
        </li>
        <li>
            Divide noodles between serving bowls; top with meatballs, veggies, and as much broth as you <br>
            like. (You may have some broth left over—second helpings!) Top with scallion greens and as much <br>
            garlic chili oil as you like. Serve.
        </li>
