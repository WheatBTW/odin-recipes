    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        Seitan, a wheat-based Japanese protein, lends heartiness to this classic chili. A touch of smoky chipotle <br>
        gives this dish an extra kick. Finished with gooey cheddar, this is vegetarian comfort food at its finest.

    <h2>Cooking Instructions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>
            Cook the rice: In a small pot, bring 1 cup salted water to a boil. Once boiling, add the rice, cover, <br>
            and simmer for 15-20 minutes, until tender. Remove from the heat and keep covered until the rest <br>
            of the meal is ready.
        </li>
        <li>
            Mince or grate the garlic. Halve, seed, and remove the white ribs from the bell pepper, then finely <br>
            dice. Halve, peel, and dice the red onion. Thinly slice the scallions, keeping the whites <br>
            and the greens separate. Core and dice the tomato. Drain and rinse the beans.
        </li>
        <li>
            Heat 2 Tablespoons oil in a large pan over medium heat. Add the pepper, onion, and scallion <br>
            whites and cook, tossing for 3-5 minutes, until softened. Add the garlic, tomatoes, and seitan to <br>
            the pan, and cook for 3-5 minutes, breaking up the seitan into small pieces.
        </li>
        <li>
            Add the beans to the pot along with the stock concentrate and 1 cup water. Simmer for 5-7 <br>
            minutes, until thickened. Season with salt and pepper. TIP: If you have time, let the chili simmer <br>
            longer. The flavors will get even better!
        </li>
        <li>
            Finish and plate: Serve the chipotle seitan chili on a bed of jasmine rice and garnish with the <br>
            reserved scallion greens and cheddar cheese.
